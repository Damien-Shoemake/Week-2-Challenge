# Week-2-Challenge

## Portfolio Website

## Goal of this week's project:

In this week's project we were to make a portfolio that can be built upon and presented to employers at the end of our course.

This week's project was also meant to test what we have learned about css and html. 

This portfolio contains: 

- Placeholder images for professional avatars
- A small "About Me" section to familiarize potential employers with me. 
- A contact section to let employers communicate with me
- A navigation menu at the top of the page to jump around the page itself
